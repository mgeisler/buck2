In Buck2, the same build action takes 0.1 seconds. Actions that should be fast are fast, which enables developers to use Buck more freely, without trying to work around the build system.Slow things are faster - when there is real work to do, Buck2 is significantly closer to the critical path. Benchmarks range from 5%/10s faster for changing a header file (lots of parallel C++ computations, Buck1 already nearly at the critical path) to 42%/145s faster (changing a Thrift file in a large project).Users contribute to the shared cache - with Buck1, only trusted CI builds write to the network cache, while with Buck2 everyone writes to the cache through sandboxed remote execution. This increases the chance of cache hits, saving capacity and time.CI builds go faster - these numbers vary day by day, but most projects are 2-4x faster. This means spending less time waiting for CI and saving some capacity at the same time. Correctness - in Buck2, rules are hermetic by default. Missing dependencies are errors. These restrictions apply to both the user-written BUCK files and the language rules. During the process of migrating to Buck2, a huge number of missing dependencies have been fixed. However, during the same process, several Buck1 issues were identified that are not going to be fixed in Buck1 (such as missing headers, genrules without dependencies, and OCaml rules don’t track all deps). The end result is that Buck2 gives the right answer more often, cutting down on user surprises. Rule features - the rules in Buck2, especially for less commonly used languages (such as Haskell, OCaml, and Rust) support features above and beyond those in Buck1. Examples: dependencies can be given as arguments to prebuilt_ocaml_library, Haskell enables the use of stub headers from C++, and Rust has experimental pipelining support. Actively developed - the Meta build team is putting all its efforts behind Buck2; it's vastly easier to develop than Buck1. While Buck2 is already ahead of Buck1 in many important aspects, the difference is only going to grow with several improvements in the pipeline.Support - Meta can provide much better support to those having difficulties with Buck2 than to those using Buck1.

Buck2 rules are so much more hackable than Buck1.&quot; - Software Engineer feedback There are a number of reasons why Buck2 excels for Rule Authors: Faster developer cycle - in Buck1, the time from changing a rule to seeing the impact is many minutes: you first have to compile Buck1, invalidate the dependency cache (and so on), and perhaps work between multiple OSs. With Buck2, it takes seconds, you don’t even need to restart the daemon.Simple API - Buck2 rules use a small and documented Starlark API, which is dependency-correct by construction. In Buck1, the rules must obey a lot of subtle side conditions with a much larger API.Easier deployment - for Buck2, deployment is just checking the rules in, with an atomic commit changing associated macros (when required). For Buck1, you have to make the repo work with the old and new rules and wait for a Buck version bump to ship your changes, perhaps a few days later.Low barrier to entry - writing rules in Buck2 is vastly easier than Buck1, significantly increasing the developer pool. This means that writing rules is now accessible to language experts, not just Buck experts.

In Buck2, these commands are faster and use less memory. For example, on CI target determination (a bunch of targets/queries), Buck2 is 25% faster at P50 (moving to 40% faster at P95) with 25% less memory (saving over 20Gb, and crossing below the 64Gb threshold). Profiling - Buck2 already ships with five types of profiling for both loading and analysis (flame graphs, statement breakdown, heap profiles etc). With Buck2, these tools are much more easily accessible to people not on the Build Infra team.

There may be issues, but they will be fixed as quickly as possible (and lessons learned) through the through Meta's SEV-review process.Corner cases - Buck1 has been battle-tested for nearly a decade, which has included attention to events such as error messages in unlikely corner cases.

Before executing, Buck2 reads this file to incorporate specified customizations. For more information, refer to the Legacy docs. Action​ An individual, cacheable, ideally hermetic command that's run during the build. It takes artifacts as inputs and produces other artifacts as outputs. An example command could be gcc -o main main.c, which takes the artifact main.c (a source file) and produces the artifact called main (the compiled binary). Action graph​ The dependency graph of all actions belonging to a target: it can be queried with buck2 aquery. Artifact​ A single input or output of an action. These are files that participate as inputs or outputs of a build and can be source files or build outputs. For more information, see the Artifact API. Attribute​ Declared by a rule and used to express the properties of a particular instance of a rule to create a target. For example, srcs, deps and copts, which declare a target's source files, dependencies, and custom compiler options, respectively. The available attributes for a target depend on its rule type. BUCK file​ A BUCK file (the name is configurable, some projects use TARGETS) is the main configuration file that tells Buck2 what to build, what their dependencies are, and how to build them. Buck2 takes a BUCK file as input and evaluates the file to declare targets, which are then used to create a graph of dependencies and to derive the actions that must be completed to build intermediate and final software outputs. A BUCK file marks a directory and any sub-directories not containing a BUCK file as a package. BXL​ BXL (Buck eXtension Language) scripts are written in Starlark (a restricted subset of Python) and give integrators the ability to inspect and interact directly with the buck2 graph. BXL scripts can query the action graph, configured graph, and unconfigured graph. They can also create actions and trigger builds. Cell​ The directory tree of one or more Buck2 packages. A Buck2 build can involve multiple cells. The cell root always contains a .buckconfig, although the presence of a .buckconfig file doesn't in itself define a cell. Rather, the cells involved in a build are defined at the time Buck2 is invoked; they are specified in the .buckconfig for the Buck project. Configuration​ Configurations consist of a set of 'constraint values' that are used to resolve select attributes prior to evaluating rule implementations: the attribute takes the value of the first branch in the select that matches the configuration. Configurations are instantiated by rules that produce a PlatformInfo provider. Once created, targets can receive their configuration through a variety of mechanisms, such as: Inheritance - by default, when following a dependency edge A -&gt; B, B inherits A's configuration.The default_target_platform attribute and --target-platforms command line flag.Transitions (see below). Configurations allow a single target to exist in multiple variants in the configured graph (for example, to build a given binary at differing optimization levels or targeting different CPU architectures). Configured graph​ A graph of targets after configurations are applied. Can be queried via buck2 cquery. Daemon​ The Daemon process lives between invocations and is designed to allow for cache reuse between Buck2 invocations, which can considerably speed up builds. For more information, see Daemon (buckd). Dependency​ A directed edge between two targets. A target A can have a dependency on target B, for example, if any dep attribute of A mentions B. A target's dependence on another target is determined by the visibility of the latter. Execution platform​ A type of rule that includes information such as what execution types a target supports, which can be remote, local, and hybrid execution. Also, whether it supports cache uploads, which allows users to get cache hits for things that executed locally. Hybrid execution​ Enables shifting work to the local host when available parallelism in the build is low. This enables users to save on remote execution roundtrips to enable faster builds. Isolation dir​ Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical. The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2. Package​ A directory that contains a Buck2 BUCK file and all source files belonging to the same directory as the BUCK file, or any of its subdirectories that do not contain a BUCK file themselves. Project​ The Outermost directory where there is a .buckconfig: also known as the root cell. The .buckconfig for the project specifies the cells that constitute the Buck2 project. Specifically, these cells are specified in the '[repositories]' section of the .buckconfig. All command invocations are executed from the project root. Provider​ Data returned from a rule function. It's the only way that information from this rule is available to other rules that depend on it (see dependency). Every rule must return at least the DefaultInfo provider. A common case is to also return either RunInfo (because they are executable) or custom providers that the dependents rule can use. For more information, see Providers. Remote execution (RE)​ Distributed execution of actions on remote workers. It can speed up builds significantly by scaling the nodes available for parallel actions, and by caching action outputs across Buck2 users. Rule​ A rule consists of an attribute spec and an implementation, which is a Starlark function. The attribute spec declares what attributes the rule expects to receive. The rule implementation receives the attributes of a target and the providers of its dependencies. It can declare new actions and artifacts and must return providers that can be used to pass data to its dependents or to Buck2 itself. Rules are instantiated in BUCK files to declare targets and set their attributes. The rule implementation is called when Buck2 needs its providers, which can happen when the target is built, or when one of its dependents is. As an example, the cxx_binary rule could be used to create a C++ binary, but android_binary rule would be used to create an Android APK Target​ An object that is defined in a BUCK file. Targets represent the buildable units of a build from the perspective of the end user. Declared by instantiating a rule with attributes. A target has dependencies, which are references to other targets. Target label​ The identifier for a target. Structured as cellAlias//path/to/package:target, where cellAlias// maps to a cell root path (as defined in the ./buckconfig of the cell this target belongs to), path/to/package is the package directory that contains the BUCK file declaring the target (relative to the mapped cell alias), and :target is the target's name. Target pattern​ A string that resolves to a set of targets. They can be used as arguments to commands such as buck2 build and buck2 uquery. They can also be used in the visibility argument of a rule. For more information, see Target pattern. Transition​ Allows the configuration to change across a dependency edge. That is, normally, if target A depends on target B, then if the configuration for A is X, then B is configured using X too. By using a transition, you can produce X to configure B instead. Unconfigured graph​ A graph of targets before configurations are applied. Can be queried via buck2 uquery. Visibility​ Determines whether a target can include another target as its dependency.

For the sake of simplicity, imagine B and C are C++ compilations (that produce object files), and A is a link (that consumes them and produces a shared library). Building A with Buck1​ Following is an oversimplified view of what happens: Buck1 computes the 'rulekey' for B. This consists of mixing together the hashes of the C++ file being compiled, as well as all C++ compiler flags, and so on. Buck1 then does the same for C.Buck1 then computes the rulekey for A. This consist of mixing together the rulekeys of B and C, as well as linker flags used by A. for example. Buck1 then looks up the rulekey for A in the cache. If there's a hit, then Buck1 downloads the output and its job done.If there's a cache miss, continue. Buck1 then queries the cache for the rulekeys of B and C: If there's a hit, then the output is downloaded.If there's a miss, then Buck1 runs the commands needed to produce the object file that was missed. Regardless of whether those commands run locally or on RE, Buck1 downloads the output of B and C. Buck1 then runs the command for A to produce the shared library. At this point, Buck1 may actually do another cache lookup with a different rulekey, which is called an input based rulekey. This rulekey is derived from the inputs of the action that needs executing, which at this point of the build are known (since they were just built)! Building A with Buck2​ In contrast, if you ask Buck2 to build A, here is what happens: Buck2 produce the action to compile B and computes the hash of the action. This is the 'action digest', which consists of mixing the hashes of all the inputs (such as the C++ file), as well as the command line (so, implicitly, the compiler flags). Buck2 queries the action cache for the action digest hash. If there's a hit, Buck2 obtains the hash of the resulting object file (that is, the output of B).If there's a miss, Buck2 runs the action on RE (or potentially locally) and obtains the hash of the object file. If the action runs remotely, Buck2 will not download the output. Buck2 does the same thing for C.Buck2 produces the action to link A. This consists of mixing together all the hashes of the input files (which were retrieved earlier) and the command line to produce an action digest, then querying the cache and potentially running the action. Once Buck2 produces A (again, on RE), then, since this output was requested by the user (unlike the intermediary outputs B and C), Buck2 downloads A.

Since it’s a product of the (transitive) inputs of an action, the (default) rulekey can be computed without running anything or querying any caches. However, the action digest cannot: it requires the actual inputs of an action, which means you need to build all the dependencies first. This means that: In Buck1, you can ask for rulekeys for a target.In Buck2, you’d have to run the build first then ask for the action digests (this is what the buck2 log what-ran would show you). Buck2 queries many more caches​ Buck1 will not descend further down a tree of dependency when it gets a cache hit.Buck2 will always walk up all your dependencies, regardless of whether you get cache hits or not. Materialization​ When Buck1 gets a cache miss, it downloads the outputs.Buck2, by contract, does not download outputs as part of a build (this is called 'deferred materialization'). Note that Buck2 does download the outputs if the user asked for them (that is, they were the targets the user put on the command line). "},{"title":"Second-order implications​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Buck1 vs Buck2","url":"/docs/developers/architecture/buck1_vs_buck2/#second-order-implications","content":"Non-determinism​ Non-determinism in a build affects Buck2 and Buck1 differently. One scenario that often works fine in Buck1 but can work catastrophically bad in Buck2 is a codegen step, driven by a Python binary. In certain configurations/modes, Python binaries are non-deterministic, because they are XARs and that is always non-deterministic, which is bad! In Buck1, that doesn’t really matter, because you can get a cache hit on the codegen output without ever visiting the XAR (as long as the input files haven’t changed).In Buck2, you need the XAR to check the action cache for the codegen step. However, binaries are often not cached in certain configurations/modes, so your XAR isn’t cached.Therefore, since your XAR build is non-deterministic, you’ll always miss in the action cache and the codegen step will always have to run in every build. It can get worse! If the Python binary produces non-deterministic codegen, then the entire build might become uncacheable. Cache misses don’t necessarily propagate​ Say that, in Buck2, you’re trying to build a chain of actions like codegen -&gt; compile -&gt; link. Even if your codegen step isn’t cached (say, because its action inputs are non-deterministic as mentioned above), as long as the codegen output is deterministic, you can still get cache hits from compile and link steps. Hybrid execution​ If you squint, you’ll note that Buck1’s build could be viewed as 'local first', whereas Buck2’s would be better viewed as 'remote first': When Buck1 builds something remotely or gets a cache hit, the outputs are always downloaded.When Buck2 builds something remotely or gets a cache hit, the outputs are never downloaded. In turn, this has some important implications: When Buck1 builds something locally, the inputs are always already present.When Buck2 builds something locally, the inputs have to be downloaded, unless they were built locally (which if you’re doing any RE, is usually not the case), or if another command caused them to be downloaded. This means that, in Buck1, running something locally when you have spare resources is usually a no-brainer, because it’s always ready to go, and you’ll save on not having to download the output from RE (though you might have to upload the output if you need to run actions depending on it later). On the flip side, with Buck2, that’s not necessarily the case. To run an action locally, you need to download inputs that you might otherwise not have needed, which will tax your network connection.

It’s possible that one use case could be handled by both BXL and Buck2. Following are some specific recommendations to help decide when to use BXL over regular Buck2: Use/inspect resolved attributes that are not exposed/accessible to users via normal Buck2 operations. This includes introspecting the Starlark object of providers, analyzing the Starlark object of a rule’s attr before and after coercing and resolution, and introspecting intermediate query results. Reduce/eliminate the need to make several Buck2 calls within your program, such as running several subprocesses to call cquery several times. With BXL, you can just call the BXL script once in a subprocess, potentially reducing the amount of code you need to write in your program. Reduce/eliminate the need to manually parse Buck2 output format within your program, and any bugs that may come with manual parsing. Some languages are more verbose than others when it comes to string parsing.BXL scripts are written in Starlark, which is basically a deterministic, immutable Python, and are able to directly introspect Starlark objects (such as rules and target nodes, and so on) and call methods on these objects instead of parsing them over Buck2’s output.

The computations themselves (uquery, cquery, and build) will still be incrementally evaluated via DICE, so we are not rerunning every computation entirely within the BXL. When the BXL script creates artifacts and ensures them, those artifacts are cached separately in an action outside of of the BXL execution. This means that the artifacts produced by BXL are cached separately from the BXL script itself, much like the computations within a BXL.

Starlark, which is a deterministic, immutable version of Python, is used to extend the Buck2 build system, enabling Buck2 to be language-agnostic. The high-level flow starts with a user creating a build file (a BUCK file) containing one or more targets, which is specified by the target label, its inputs (sources, attributes, configurations, and dependencies), and the type of macro or rule to use. Briefly, a macro is a wrapper around a rule, which runs necessary commands to generate what’s needed for a target (for example, for a cxx_binary target, generate the header map and run necessary clang commands). Macros can be used to reduce boilerplate code for users (such as to supply the same set of attributes for a rule for all targets). Macros and rules are both written in Starlark and are specified by input sources, attributes, and the implementation function. If the target type is a macro, then the macro will fill in some details (for example, for a cxx_binary target, these are the compilation, debug flags to use, this is the clang to use). If the target type is a rule, then the macro layer is skipped altogether. This is all orchestrated by the core, which performs operations such as executing Buck2 CLI args, generating/updating the dependency graph (which contains the configured target nodes, unconfigured target nodes, action nodes, among other types of nodes that all allow for incrementality and execution), and materializing the artifacts. The core is written in Rust. The following diagram shows the high-level overview.  The Buck2 CLI runs in a client process, which sends commands to the Buck2 daemon via gRPC. The daemon goes through several phases after receiving a request from the client: evaluation, configuration, analysis, execution, and materialization (see Execution Model, below).

Each build file is uniquely identified by the directory in which it's located. Since all build files have the same name, there cannot be two build files in the same directory. This is usually represented as the relative path from the root of the project (the directory where the .buckconfig file is). Each build file has a set of targets. These describe the things the user wants Buck2 to know about. Each target has a type and a set of named attributes, including at least a name (also known as the label) identifying it. Additional attributes depend on the type of the target. "},{"title":"Phase A: Evaluation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Architectural Model","url":"/docs/developers/architecture/buck2/#phase-a-evaluation","content":"First, Buck2 evaluates a build file, and then constructs an unconfigured target graph. Buck2 performs directory listings to discover packages, then evaluates the build files that were found, expands any macros detected into their underlying rules, and then will take rule attributes and convert them from Starlark to Rust types to construct a target node, and insert it into the unconfigured target graph, which is a smaller portion of Buck2’s larger dependency graph. The target node consists of a reference to rule implementation, and the set of attributes and sources. The result of evaluation is a list of targets read from the build file mapped to a target node in Buck2 unconfigured target graph.

This is also known as target platform resolution, and can be configured within the target, the buckconfig, propagated from dependencies, or passed into the CLI.

For example, the target’s dependencies are turned into a ProviderCollection, source files are converted into StarlarkArtifacts, and String attributes are turned into a StarlarkString. This ctx object is backed by Buck2’s dependency graph for computation and rules use it to tell Buck2 to run actions, create dynamic actions, or create new files. The rule will return a list of providers, which is data that the rule wants to expose to its dependents (that is, can flow through the dependency graph), such as output artifact information (such as file paths and file hashes). Providers could be actions, source files, or attributes. Within the returned list, DefaultInfo always needs to be returned, which indicates what the default outputs are. Some other common built-in providers include RunInfo, TestInfo, and InstallInfo. The end result is a list of providers and actions (inserted into the action graph) that Buck2 needs to execute to produce the desired outputs, known as 'bound artifacts'.

The critical path is the theoretical lower bound for the duration of a build, which are the slowest set of actions. Buck2 can be run locally or on remote execution, or in a hybrid manner. For each action, an input action digest is created from the action (hash of command line and all of the action’s inputs), uploaded, and cached within RE. This is known as the RE action cache. If there is a cache hit, then Buck2 does not need to run the command for the action, and RE returns the output action digest. This is known as remote execution. If there is not a cache hit, then local execution has to be done, where all the action’s input files are retrieved from the filesystem (most likely from EdenFS), computation is run on these source files, and then outputted to buck-out using I/O operations in the filesystem. Hybrid execution allows Buck2 to race local and remote execution and return the returns of whichever finishes first for a performance speedup. These action digests are how Buck2 communicates with RE. The action outputs, including final/build artifacts, intermediaries, file, directories, and symlinks related to the build, are then materialized (downloaded to disk), and can be found in the buck-out path. There are different configurations that a user can set to control how materialization is handled.

Using it, you'll be able to access functions that enable you to perform queries, analysis, builds, and even create your own actions within BXL to build artifacts as part of a BXL function. The primary method to return information from BXL is to either print them, or build some artifact (for details, see the OutputStream documentation, available as part of ctx.output). At high level, ctx.output.print(..) prints results to stdout, and ctx.output.ensure(artifact) marks artifacts as to be materialized into buck-out by the end of the BXL function, returning an object that lets you print the output path via ctx.output.print(ensured).

Whether a def is frozen or not, when it's executed, its local variables are not frozen. In addition, two non-standards-conforming ways of defining variables are supported: Some modules can be injected as bindings in advance. Given a module foo that is injected, all the bindings of foo will be inserted in this module as frozen.The function load_symbols injects a dictionary of bindings into the module environment. Note that a module has a fixed set of variables (from the standards-conforming ways), a pre-execution set (from the injections) and yet more variables at runtime (via load_symbols). To support that structure, the mapping from name to slot index is tracked in a struct: enum Names { Frozen(FrozenNames), Names(Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;HashMap&lt;String, usize&gt;&gt;&gt;), } struct FrozenNames(Arc&lt;HashMap&lt;String, usize&gt;&gt;);  Each name is given an entry in the map with an increasing slot index.

To support this structure, at runtime we pass around the context, defined as: struct Context { names: Names, slots: Vec&lt;Slots&gt;, }  The above code contains the mapping of names for the module and the slots for the module and each function. When executed, the inner-most Slots (at the end of slots:) will never be frozen, as that represents the local variables: but any other may be. When a function value is captured in a frozen module, use FrozenContext: struct FrozenContext { names: FrozenNames, slots: Vec&lt;FrozenSlots&gt;, } ## List comprehension environments A list comprehension can be defined as: ```python [x for x in [1,2,3]]  In the above code: The statement defines a variable x that is immediately initialised and shadows any other variables x in scope.The variable x cannot be assigned to, other than in the list comprehension, as it only lives inside the comprehension and the comprehension does not permit assignment statements (only expressions).

The Y memory location has both some data of its own (&quot;hello&quot;) and two pointers (X and Y itself). The pointers from outside the heap into the heap are known as roots. Assuming, in the above example, that Y is the only root, then, since Y is used from outside, Y must be moved to the new memory block. Consequently, the data X needs to be copied, but Z can be dropped. Following are the required steps for using a garbage collector: To copy Y, allocate a value in the new heap A with a sentinel value in it (that that sentinel is called a Blackhole). Then, turn Y into a Forward(A) pointer, so that if anyone else in this cycle tries to collect Y they immediately &quot;forward&quot; to the new value and the data from Y is grabbed so its pointers can be traversed. That results in the following: X := Data(&quot;world&quot;) Y := Forward(A) Z := Data(&quot;universe&quot;) A := Blackhole With Data(&quot;hello&quot;, X, Y) as the current item being processed. Walk the pointers of the current value, performing a garbage collection on each of them. To copy Y, it can be seen that Y points at a Forward(A) node, so there's no need to do anything. To copy X, follow the process starting at step 1, but for X (which ends up at B). Performing that move leads to the following: X := Forward(B) Y := Forward(A) Z := Data(&quot;universe&quot;) A := Blackhole B := Data(&quot;world&quot;) Replace all the pointers with the forwarded value, and write it back over the Blackhole in A. This gives the following: X := Forward(B) Y := Forward(A) Z := Data(&quot;universe&quot;) A := Data(&quot;hello&quot;, B, A) B := Data(&quot;world&quot;) Adjust any roots pointing at Y to point at A and throw away the original heap, which produces the following: A := Data(&quot;hello&quot;, B, A) B := Data(&quot;world&quot;)  These above four steps successfully garbage collects a cyclic data structure, while preserving the cycles and getting rid of the unused data.

Note that this API can only point at a FrozenValue from another heap, and only after that heap has been turned into a reference, so it will not be allocated in anymore. These restrictions are deliberate and mean that most programs only have one 'active heap' at a time. Following are some places where heap references are added by Starlark: Before evaluation is started, a reference is added to the Globals from the Module, so it can access the global functions.When evaluating a load statement, a reference is added to the FrozenModule that is being loaded.When freezing a module, the FrozenHeap, in the Module, is moved to the FrozenModule, preserving the references that were added.

This structure is a pair of a FrozenHeapRef and a FrozenValue, where the ref keeps the value alive. You can move that OwnedFrozenValue into the value of a module with code such as: fn move&lt;'v&gt;(from: &amp;FrozenModule, to: &amp;'v Module) { let x : OwnedFrozenValue = from.get(&quot;value&quot;).unwrap(); let v : Value&lt;'v&gt; = x.owned_value(&amp;to); to.set(&quot;value&quot;, v); }  In general, you can use the OwnedFrozenValue in one of three ways: Operate on it directly - with methods like unpack_int or to_str.Extract it safely - using methods like owned_frozen_value, which takes a FrozenHeap to which the heap reference is added and returns a naked FrozenValue. After that, it is then safe for the FrozenHeap you passed in to use the FrozenValue. With owned_value, there is lifetime checking that the right heap is passed, but with FrozenValue, there isn't.Be careful to pass the right heap, although given most programs only have one active heap at a time, it should mostly work out. Extract it unsafely - using methods unchecked_frozen_value, which gives you the underlying FrozenValue without adding any references. Be careful to make sure there is a good reason the FrozenValue remains valid.

If the value doesn't match, it is a runtime error. Similarly, on return statements, or the end of the function, a check is made that result type matches int.type. Types match using the following rules: The type &quot;&quot; means anything.The type &quot;foo&quot; means any value of type foo, where the type of x is computed by doing type(x). That means that &quot;int&quot;, &quot;bool&quot; and &quot;string&quot; are common types.Most constructor functions provide a .type property to obtain the type they produce, allowing int.type, bool.type and str.type etc.Any string starting with an underscore _ (for example, &quot;_a&quot; means anything) but the name is often used as a hint to say where types go in polymorphic functions.The type None means the result must be None.The singleton list [t] means a list where each element must be of type t. If you want a list of any types, use [&quot;&quot;].Multiple element lists [t1,t2] are OR types, where the value must be either type t1 OR type t2.A tuple (t1, t2, t3) matches tuples of the same length (3 in this case), where each element of the value must match the corresponding element of the tuple.A singleton dictionary {k: v} means a dictionary where all the keys have type k, and all the values have type v.It is possible to define functions that return types. For example, def StrDict(t): return {str.type: t} would mean StrDict(int.type) was a valid type. The goals of this type system are: Reuse the existing machinery of Starlark as much as possible, avoiding inventing a special class of type values. As a consequence, any optimisations for values like string/list are reused.Provide a pleasing syntax.Some degree of compatibility with Python, which allows types as expressions in the same places Buck2 allows them (but with different meaning and different checking).And finally, a non-goal is to provide a complete type system capable of representing every type invariant: it's intended to be a lossy approximation.

Therefore, we can know that the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that Buck constructs from the build rule is an accurate reflection of the build's dependencies, and that once a rule's dependencies are satisfied, the target for that rule can be built. Having a DAG makes it straightforward for rules to be built in parallel, which can dramatically reduce build times. Buck starts with the leaf nodes of the graph, that is, targets that have no dependencies. Buck adds these to a queue of targets to build. When a thread is available, Buck removes a target from the front of the queue and builds it. Assuming the target builds successfully, Buck notifies all of the rules that depend on that target. When all of a rule's dependencies have been satisfied, Buck adds that rule's target to the build queue. Computation proceeds in this manner until all of the nodes in the graph have been built. This execution model means that breaking modules into finer dependencies creates opportunities for increased parallelism, which improves throughput.

This means that the compilation step in your build sees only explicitly-declared dependencies, not other libraries that those dependencies themselves depend on. Using only first-order dependencies dramatically shrinks the set of APIs that your Java code is exposed to, which dramatically reduces the scope of changes that will trigger a rebuild.NOTE: If your rule does, in fact, depend on a dependency of one of your explicitly-specified dependencies—such as a second-order dependency—you can make that dependency available to your rule by specifying it in an exported_deps argument in the rule of the explicitly-specified dependency. "},{"title":"Buck uses dependency files to trim over-specified inputs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What Makes Buck so Fast?","url":"/docs/legacy/about/fast/#buck-uses-dependency-files-to-trim-over-specified-inputs","content":"Buck's low-level build rules specify all inputs—such as source files or the outputs from other build rules—that might contribute to the output when the build rule is executed. Normally, changes to any of these inputs result in a new RuleKey and therefore trigger a rebuild. However, in practice, it's not uncommon for these build rules to over-specify their inputs. A good example is Buck's C/C++ compilation rules. C/C++ compilation rules specify as inputs all headers found from the transitive closure of C/C++ library dependencies, even though in many cases only a small subset of these headers are actually used. For example, a C/C++ source file might use only one of many headers exported by a C/C++ library dependency. However, there's not enough information available before running the build to know if any given input is used, and so all inputs must be considered, which can lead to unnecessary rebuilding. In some cases, after the build completes, Buck can figure out the exact subset of the listed inputs that were actually used. In C/C++, compilers such as gcc provide a -M option which produces a dependency file. This file identifies the exact headers that were used during compilation. For supported rules, Buck uses this dependency file before the build, to try to avoid an unnecessary rebuilding: If the dependency file is available before the build, Buck reads the file and uses it to filter out unused inputs when constructing the RuleKey.If no dependency file is available before the build, Buck runs the build as normal and produces a dependency file. The dependency file is then available for subsequent builds. Note that dependency files are used only if the standard RuleKey—which considers all inputs—doesn't match. In cases where the RuleKey matches, the output from the rule can be fetched from the cache.

For example, if your project had the following BUCK files: java/com/facebook/base/BUCK java/com/facebook/common/BUCK java/com/facebook/common/collect/BUCK Then your build rules would have the following constraints: Rules in java/com/facebook/base/BUCK can reference any file under java/com/facebook/base/.Rules in java/com/facebook/common/ can reference any files under that directory, except for those under java/com/facebook/common/collect/, as those &quot;belong&quot; to the BUCK file in the collect directory.

Similarly, the final product of most Android development is an APK, so you can use the build rule android_binary to create an APK. This documentation organizes Buck's build rules by development language and by target platform. Examples are: C++, Java, Python (development languages) and Android, iOS, .NET (target platforms). Consult the table of contents to locate the build rules that are appropriate for your development project. You can view a list of Buck's build rules from the command line with the command: buck audit ruletypes  You can view the arguments supported by a particular rule with the command: buck audit ruletype &lt;rule&gt;  Note that the first of these commands uses the plural ruletypes, and the second uses the singular ruletype.

Some languages, such as C++, use header files as well. To specify these, cxx_library provides a headers argument. In addition to srcs and headers, some rules provide variants of these arguments, such as platform_srcs and platform_headers. These arguments support groups of source files that should be used as inputs only when building for specific platforms. For more information, see the descriptions for platform_srcs and platform_headers in, for example, the cxx_library topic.

(To learn more, see the Key Concepts topic.) A rule in a BUCK file cannot specify a source file as an input unless that source file is in that BUCK file's package. An exception to this restriction exists for header files, but only if a rule in the package that contains the header file exports that header file using the exported_headers argument. For more details, see the description for exported_headers in, for example, the cxx_library topic. More commonly though, the package for a BUCK file contains all the source files required for the rules defined in that BUCK file. Functionality in source files from other packages is made available through the artifacts produced by the rules in the BUCK files for those packages. For example, a cxx_binary might use the functionality in a cxx_library that is defined in another package. To access that functionality, the cxx_binary would take that cxx_library as a dependency. Symlinks: Use with caution if at all​ We recommend that you do not use symlinks—either absolute or relative—to specify input files to build rules.

Typically, a build rule specifies its dependencies as a list of build targets in its deps argument. However, the rule can also specify dependencies—as build targets—in other arguments, such as srcs.Example: The output of a java_library rule is a JAR file. If a java_library rule specifies another java_library rule as a dependency, the JAR file produced by the specified rule is added to the classpath for the java_library that depends on it.Example: If a java_binary rule specifies a java_library rule as a dependency, the JAR file for the specified java_library is available on the classpath for the java_binary. In addition, in the case of java_binary, the JAR files for any dependencies of the java_library rule are also made available to the java_binary rule—and if those dependencies have dependencies of their own, they are added as well.

Consider the following example of a fully-qualified build target used with the buck build command: buck build //java/com/facebook/share:share  Although Buck is always strict when parsing build targets in build files, Buck is flexible when parsing build targets on the command-line. Specifically, the leading // is optional on the command line, so the above could be: buck build java/com/facebook/share:share  Also, if there is a forward slash before the colon, it is ignored, so this could also be written as: buck build java/com/facebook/share/:share  which enables you to produce the red text shown below using tab-completion, which dramatically reduces how much you need to type: buck build java/com/facebook/share/:share  Finally, if the final path element matches the value specified after the colon, it can be omitted: # This is treated as //java/com/facebook/share:share. buck build java/com/facebook/share/  which makes the build target even easier to tab-complete. For this reason, the name of the build rule for the primary deliverable in a build file is often named the same as the parent directory.

For example, if flags is a key value interpreted as a list of items separated by spaces, then flags = -foo &quot;-bar \\u0429&quot;  results in the two strings: foo and -bar Щ; the space character between -bar and \\u0429 is not interpreted as a separator.

These included files can contain complete .buckconfig sections or they can contain a group of key name/value pairs that constitute part of a section. In this second use case, you'll need to ensure that the included file is referenced beneath the appropriate section in the including file. Because of this additional complexity, we recommend that you include only files that contain complete sections.Note: Inclusion of files is a Buck-specific extension to the INI file parser that Buck uses. Therefore, if you use this feature, your Buck configuration files will probably not be parsable by other more-generic INI file parsers. The syntax to include a file is &lt;file:*path-to-included-file*&gt;  where path-to-included-file is either a relative path from the including file (recommended) or an absolute path from the root of the file system. You can also specify that the file should be included only if it exists by prefixing with a question mark (?). &lt;?file:*path-to-included-file*&gt;  If you use this prefix, it is not an error condition if the file does not exist; Buck just silently continues to process the rest of the configuration file. In the following example, the .buckconfig file includes the file cxx-other-platform.include which exists in the subdirectory cxx-other-platform.

As this is commonly the case for tools, this flag is frequently used in concert with --config client.id: $ buck build //big:expensive-rule # Initial Action Graph. $ buck build //big:expensive-rule # Action Graph is reused. $ buck build \\ # Cached Graph is unaffected.--config client.skip-action-graph-cache=true \\ --config client.id=nuclide \\ //library#compilation-database $ buck build //big:expensive-rule # Action Graph is reused.

To create a new C/C++ platform flavor, add a section with the header [cxx#**flavor**]  to .buckconfig. If you invoke Buck with the specified flavor appended to the build target, Buck uses the values in this section instead of those in [cxx]. For example, to build with the values in [cxx#my-custom-flavor] instead of [cxx], you could invoke Buck using the following command: $ buck build app#my-custom-flavor  You can also use these platform flavors, in the platform_* arguments of the cxx_binary and cxx_library rules.

This improves build times by allowing each library's dependents to start building before the library is done building. Implies jar_spool_mode = direct_to_jar.source_only: creates an ABI jar for each library by referencing only the source code of the library, without considering (most of) its dependencies. This can drastically improve build times, especially in larger apps or in build environments with a large number of cores by allowing all ABI jars to be built in parallel, and then all library jars to be built in parallel (up to the available parallelism in the build environment). Additionally, in environments with network-based caches it can reduce the number of calls to the cache required for each build. Requires some changes to how Java code is written. To migrate, first do some builds in migrating_to_source_only mode, using buck fix to fix any issues encountered. Once migrated, errors will still be encountered from time to time when new code does not meet the requirements of this mode.buck fix can be used to address these. When building with source_only, using buck build --keep-going is recommended since some errors that occur when building an ABI jar will actually have their root cause in another rule that builds later.

It allows users to define, for each target, the targets it can depend on and targets that can depend on it. Visibility is specified as an allowlist of targets/target patterns, and any target used that falls outside of the allowlist fails visibility checking. Visibility pattern can be specified on visibility and within_view attributes in buildfiles and PACKAGE files. Visibility is important to lots of codebase maintainers because it can be used to keep projects from pulling in unwanted dependencies. As some examples, App Core teams are using Buck visibility as a replacement to current supermodules for protecting app modularity. Instagram's using visibility to protect modularity and define Link Groups used for build speed optimizations. There's interest from various DevX teams in using Buck visibility on PACKAGE files to enforce repo boundaries, which will allow target determinators to migrate off of sparse profiles and onto Eden, although visibility in its current form is likely not fit for enforcing such repo boundaries. Visibility has also been used to enforce requirements that only certain targets are allowed to depend on targets in fbcode/scripts. For perf reasons, buck2 doesn't always enforce visibility. Instead, it only enforces visibility on construction of the configured target graph. Visibility checking is expensive memory-wise because it requires tracking all deps at each node. When constructing configured target graph, this cost is already paid for when buck2 checks transitive target compatibility. When constructing the unconfigured target graph, however, this is costly, so we avoid checking visibility there. (Note that buck does not allow you to specify selects in visibility attributes.) In practice, this means that commands like cquery and build can enforce visibility whereas commands like uquery and targets cannot. Having visibility checked only on the configured target graph is problematic for 2 reasons: 1) Visibility is only checked on configured deps after selects are resolved, so it's possible for a target to pass visibility checking in one configuration but fail visibility checking in another. For example, a target may pass visibility checking on a linux configuration but fail visibility checking on mac configuration if it has a bad mac-only dependency. This makes visibility enforcement more difficult because now you have to query the same graph in both linux and mac configuration before you know that visibility is always valid. 2) Uquery (querying the unconfigured target graph) has better performance than cquery (querying the configured target graph). Big-O wise, uquery scales with O(# of targets) whereas cquery scales with O((# number of configurations) x (# of targets)). Having a way to check visibility on unconfigured target graph can be much cheaper than doing so on configured target graph.

To get the best of both worlds, I propose adding a separate command to buck2, buck2 audit visibility, that will check visibility on the unconfigured target graph. Instead of checking on construction of the unconfigured target graph, this command will check after construction, which will avoid any memory regression. The tradeoff is that the visibility checking won't be cached, and rerunning audit visibility will rerun visibility checking on each invocation. "},{"title":"Usage and Invocation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"buck2 audit visibility command","url":"/docs/rfcs/audit_visibility/#usage-and-invocation","content":"buck2 audit visibility command will take in a list of target patterns as well as common build args like config flags and mode files as args.

Checking transitive deps matches the behavior of visibility checking on cquery, but we may revisit this decision in the future if there is a need for just verifying the immediate dependencies. For example, an invocation to check visibility on the transitive closure of fbobjc can be buck2 audit visibility fbsource//fbobjc/...  It cannot be used to check that a target has a valid visibility with respect to targets outside of the transitive closure of its deps. For example, buck2 audit visibility fbcode//buck2/starlark-rust/starlark:starlark will just check that all transitive deps of starlark target (including starlark target) have valid visibility with respect to each other. It will not check that any targets that depend on starlark respect starlark target's visibility attribute.

In this scenario, we attach the analysis method onto the bxl context itself, and require that users pass in the target label-ish thing when they want to construct an analysis result. It's a little awkward in some ways because the analysis is more naturally a method on the argument being passed in and the BxlContext is a context that is needed to perform the calculation. On the other hand, this allows us to construct a type analogous to TargetExpr which can parse from a wide variety of different ConfiguredTarget like things (strings, nodes, labels, sets, ...). It also is a bit nice from an implementational standpoint since we don't have to pass the context around everywhere. This isn't a huge pro though, since we can stick it in the global eval field. result = bxl.analyze(bxl.cquery.deps(&quot;foo&quot;))  ConfiguredTargetLabel::analyze(), ConfiguredTargetNode::analyze(), ... where we carry around the BxlContext in the eval global field and implement analysis on each type that is target label like. The pro of this one is that it's quite natural - you can take a ConfiguredStarlarkTargetLabel and then just ... call analyze() on it like you might expect to. The two downsides are that we have to propagate the context around behind the scenes, and we'll have to provide an implementation of analyze on everything that we'd like to have be able to be analyzable. result = &quot;root//bin:the_binary&quot;.analyze() # but we don't support &quot;root//bin:the_binary&quot;.rdeps() # instead this looks nice nodes = ctx.cquery.deps(&quot;foo&quot;) for n in nodes: # since we can now do nodes.label nodes.attrs.field # similarly access analysis nodes.analysis  BxlContext::analysis(): AnalysisContext where AnalysisContext exposes AnalysisContext::analyze(targetlabel: ConfiguredTargetLabelLike). There's not really any pros of this approach except that it's similar to the flow for cquery where we return a cqueryctx object to call cquery methods through. result = ctx.analysis().analyze(&quot;//lib:file1&quot;)  We can also restrict the API to require that users go through cquery to obtain a ConfiguredTargetNode prior to calling analysis, although we don't have to. I say that we don't have to because the get_analysis_result method mentioned above is configured to accept a label anyway.

It’s possible to write the same features using buck calls to cquery, and build using subtargets to generate compilation database per file. However, this requires lsp owners to maintain code in several locations and languages, and parse and reserialize data. It also does not provide the same incrementality and subscription update features of the resulting comp db that writing this in bxl would have.

With bxl, the graph traversals can be written in starlark, allowing propagation of information down the graph, accessing targets’ attributes to analyze dependencies, and access providers for artifacts and action information needed to output the project file. Project generation also performs directory listings that buck2’s dice already performs and caches (I think, need to confirm). Bxl poses the interesting possibility that we can expose a limited set of IO operations that are tracked by dice so bxl can access the same cached file operations as rest of buck2. Android project generation currently doesn’t write project files to buck-out, which prevents it from using buck2 actions. It will have to rely on an external script to process the graph information printed by buck and write the actual project files.

Sample: def my_bxl(ctx): actions_factory = ctx.bxl_actions.factory() artifact = actions_factory.write(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;content&quot;) # note that existing artifacts that were declared by other rules can be built ctx.actions.build(ctx.analysis(ctx.target(&quot;foo&quot;)).providers[DefaultInfo].default_output)) return [artifact] # exposes the declared artifact to users  "},{"title":"Internal Representation (Deferred Framework)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Bxl Actions and Build API","url":"/docs/rfcs/drafts/bxl-actions/#internal-representation-deferred-framework","content":"The existing actions framework attaches all actions to a deferred, which is based off a ConfiguredLabel, which also corresponds to the output path prefix. bxl actions should also have a unique output path prefix, and follow the same system of having a base deferred key to reuse the action implementation. We should extend the BaseKey of a DeferredKey to support beyond a ConfiguredLabel, so that we can use a BxlFunctionLabel in its place. This would allow owner of these actions to point to the correct creator. The output path would be determined by using the BxlFunctionLabel as prefix similar to a label. While this means that not all outputs are associated with an actual rule, this is arguably more correct as bxl that creates outputs that doesn't fit the target graph structure (i.e android project generation follows directory structure rather than the packages defined by targets) to not have to conform the attaching their actions to existing rules. bxl functions can examine multiple rules and create a single action, attached only to their function label. The ActionRegistry will be attached to the evaluation result of bxl. Since we do not allow bxl to explicitly request build of the actions itself declares, we can wait until the end of the bxl function to finalize the actions. Then, the action lookup can simply refer to the result of the bxl. With the above changes, the rest of the actions framework does not need changed to support the proposed API.

The execution platform resolution sees through them. In other words, attrs.toolchain_dep() is like a mix of attrs.dep() and attrs.exec_dep(): it inherits target platform like attrs.dep() (so anyselect()s on the target of the attrs.toolchain_dep() will evaluate as if they were on the target containing the attrs.toolchain_dep() - the target platform gets inherited as normal) and any attrs.exec_dep()s of the attrs.toolchain_dep() target become attrs.exec_deps() on the dependent of target the attrs.toolchain_dep() (they get passed up the dep tree, so participate in exec platform resolution). This is illustrated in the following example: target( name = &quot;A&quot;, toolchain = attrs.toolchain_dep(default = &quot;:B&quot;), ) target( name = &quot;B&quot;, tool = attrs.exec_dep(default = &quot;:C&quot;) )  The above means that :C will be an execution dependency of :A and any select()s defined in :B would be evaluated against the same target platform as :A (as target platform gets inherited by attrs.toolchain_dep()s).

These inputs must include all the inputs that are referenced by the body of the function argument, apart from those listed in dynamic and outputs: extra inputs may be passed that are not used.The inputs are used for buck2 aquery functionality, but do not cause speculative building. In fact, these inputs may form a cycle with other dynamic_output actions if they were all required.In the future, it may be possible to not pass all the inputs if the repo is set to permissive mode, allowing a more powerful form of dynamic dependencies. outputs - a list of unbound artifacts (created with declare_artifact) which will be bound by the function.The function argument is given 3 arguments: ctx (context) - which is the same as that passed to the initial rule analysis.outputs - using one of the artifacts from the dynamic_output's outputs (example usage: outputs[artifact_from_dynamic_output_outputs]) gives an unbounded artifact. The function argument must use its outputs argument to bind output artifacts, rather than reusing artifacts from the outputs passed into dynamic_output directly.artifacts - using one of the artifacts from dynamic (example usage: artifacts[artifact_from_dynamic]) gives an artifact value containing the methods read_string, read_lines, and read_json to obtain the values from the disk in various formats. Anything too complex should be piped through a Python script for transformation to JSON. The function must call ctx.actions (probably ctx.actions.run) to bind all outputs. It can examine the values of the dynamic variables and depends on the inputs. The function will usually be a def, as lambda in Starlark does not allow statements, making it quite underpowered. Following is an example of using the function to determine Erlang BEAM dependencies: def erlang(ctx): beams = {} for x in ctx.attr.srcs: dep_file = ctx.actions.declare_output(x + &quot;.out&quot;) ctx.actions.run(&quot;erl&quot;, &quot;-dump-output&quot;, x, dep_file.as_output()) beam_file = ctx.actions.declare_output(x + &quot;.beam&quot;) beams[x] = beam_file def f(ctx, artifacts, outputs, x=x, dep_file=dep_file): deps = artifacts[dep_file].read_lines() ctx.actions.run( &quot;erl&quot;, &quot;-comp&quot;, x, [beams[d] for d in deps], outputs[beams[x]].as_output() ) ctx.actions.dynamic_output([dep_file], [x] + deps, [beam_file], f) return [ErlangInfo(objects = beams.values())]  The above code uses declare_output for the beam_file then binds it within the function f, after having read the dep_file with read_lines. "},{"title":"Incremental Actions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/rule_authors/incremental_actions/","content":"Incremental Actions It's possible to make certain Buck2 actions behave incrementally, that is, to produce results for a current invocation based on the result from the previous run. Incrementality could significantly improve performance of some actions such as packaging (such as Apple App Bundles) or linking (MSVC incremental linking). There are two essential requirements to make an action incremental: The result from the previous run should be accessible.An understanding of which parts of the result need to be updated; it should be easy to compare inputs from a previous run with inputs from the current run and detect those changed. The only way to run user-defined commands in Buck2 is with ctx.actions.run. Both of the above requirements are met via its metadata_env_var, metadata_path and no_outputs_cleanup parameters. When the no_outputs_cleanup flag is turned on, Buck2 won't perform any deletion of old outputs for the action. That means the result from the previous run will be accessible, but the user script has to detect which parts of it should be deleted and perform a manual cleanup. When the metadata_env_var and metadata_path parameters are present, Buck2 will create a JSON file on a disk before actually executing the command. The file will contain a list of paths and hash digests for every command action input. All paths in the file are relative to the Buck2 project root. Symlinks are not included in metadata because it is possible for the user script to resolve symlink and use a resolved path to get the destination hash digest from action metadata if it's needed, as shown in the following JSON example: { &quot;version&quot;: 1, &quot;digests&quot;: [ { &quot;path&quot;: &quot;buck-out/v2/gen/cell/configuration_hash/path/to/target/__target_name__/generated_file&quot;, &quot;digest&quot;: &quot;da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709:10&quot; }, ... ] } A user script that is run as a part of an action execution is responsible for parsing the JSON file. The version field is bumped every time there is a non-backwards compatible change to the format of the file. The user script should verify that the provided data is of a supported version and should be updated accordingly when the current version is newer than the supported one. The path of the JSON file is provided to the user script via an environment variable with a key equal to metadata_env_var. The user is able to specify the part of the path relative to the result directory via metadata_path. For example, if some rule implementation has the following code: result = ctx.actions.declare_output(&quot;result&quot;) command = cmd_args([&quot;my_script.py&quot;, &quot;--output&quot;, result.as_output()]) ctx.actions.run( command, category = &quot;my_category&quot;, metadata_env_var = &quot;ACTION_METADATA&quot;, metadata_path = &quot;action_metadata.json&quot;, no_outputs_cleanup = True, ) Then my_script.py will be executed as: ACTION_METADATA=project/relative/path/to/target/action_metadata.json my_script.py --output resolved/path/to/result my_script.py is responsible for reading the ACTION_METADATA environment variable and parsing a JSON file with the action metadata. Parsed metadata provides information about inputs for the current run, but the script needs somehow to obtain similar information about inputs from the previous run. Such information could just be another output of the user script (as with the previous result, it won't be deleted when no_outputs_cleanup = True). The Format of such a file is an implementation detail of the user script, but at the very least it should contain a list of every source that was used to form the result and hash digests for such sources. The rule implementation would look something like the following: result = ctx.actions.declare_output(&quot;result&quot;) state = ctx.actions.declare_output(&quot;incremental_state.json&quot;) command = cmd_args([&quot;my_script.py&quot;, &quot;--output&quot;, result.as_output(), &quot;--incremental-state&quot;, state.as_output()]) ctx.actions.run( command, category = &quot;my_category&quot;, metadata_env_var = &quot;ACTION_METADATA&quot;, metadata_path = &quot;action_metadata.json&quot;, no_outputs_cleanup = True, ) The user script would then: Parse incremental_state.json and delete it. Deletion prior to amending the result is important so it doesn't result in a situation where an incremental state file is out of sync with the result when the user script fails while changing the result. Such a corrupted state might lead to subsequent incorrect builds reported as &quot;successful&quot;.Parse action metadata file, compute what is needed to update the result, and amend it accordingly.Calculate the new state and write it into the new incremental_state.json.","keywords":""},{"title":"Optimization","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/rule_authors/optimization/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Starlark profiling​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Optimization","url":"/docs/rule_authors/optimization/#starlark-profiling","content":"buck2 supports profiling of the evaluation of specific BUCK files and profiling of the analysis of specific targets.

Further items can be added with cmd.add.format (optional) - a string that provides a format to apply to the argument. for example, cmd_args(x, format=&quot;--args={}&quot;) would prepend --args= before x, or if x was a list, before each element in x.delimiter (optional) - added between arguments to join them together. For example, cmd_args([&quot;--args=&quot;,x], delimiter=&quot;&quot;) would produce a single argument to the underlying tool.prepend (optional) - added as a separate argument before each argument.quote (optional) - indicates whether quoting is to be applied to each argument. Note: the only current valid value is &quot;shell&quot;. cmd.add(*args) - a list of arguments to be added to the command line, as per cmd_args. cmd.hidden(*args) - things to add to the command line which do not show up but are added as dependencies. cmd.ignore_artifacts() - conceptually the opposite of hidden(). It causes none of the arguments of the command line to be added as dependencies. Use this if you need the path to an artifact but not the artifact itself.Note: if you do find yourself needing any of the inputs referenced by this command, you will hit build errors due to missing dependencies. cmd.relative_to(directory, parent : int.type = 0) - complex magic. Before using this, please contact Meta's Buck2 team. cmd.absolute_prefix(prefix : str.type)- adds a prefix to the front of every artifact. cmd.absolute_suffix(suffix : str.type) - adds a suffix to the end of every artifact. cmd.parent(count : int.type = 1) - uses the parent of all given artifacts. Often used as cmd_args(artifact, format=&quot;-L{}&quot;).parent(). cmd.replace_regex(pattern : str.type, replacement : str.type) - replaces all parts matching pattern regular expression in each argument with replacement string. Several replacements can be added by multiple replace_regex calls. cmd.copy() - returns a copy of the cmd_args such that any modifications to the original or the returned value will not impact each other. cmd.inputs - returns a list of the artifacts that are inputs to this command line. cmd.outputs - returns a list of the artifacts that are outputs of this command line.

Consider the following example: binary = ctx.attrs.dep[RunInfo] test_info = ExternalRunnerTestInfo(command = [binary, &quot;run-tests&quot;], ...)  When Buck2 actually runs this command, binary is expanded to a path (and possibly to more args). Buck2 would also account for any hidden arguments and make those available where the command is executed. It is important for Buck2 to retain this capability when running with Tpx. To that end, all non-trivial arguments present in command (and in the values of env), such as cmd_args or RunInfo, are exposed to Tpx as opaque handles, and simple string arguments are passed as-is to Tpx. This means that Tpx would see the command described above as: [ArgHandle(index = 0), Verbatim(&quot;foobar&quot;)]  When requesting execution from Buck2, Tpx can use the ArgHandle and Buck2 will swap it back for the underlying value that was set on the provider. This allows Tpx to introspect and modify parts of the command lines it receives, as long as it doesn't need to access the actual text value of non-verbatim arguments.

Note that the actions are not run by the rule, but declared, so that Buck2 can run them later.Artifacts represent files on disk, which could be source or build outputs (binary in the above example). For build outputs, the artifact is produced by an action, and the existence of the artifact does not imply the build has been run: the artifact 'remembers' what should be run if it is required. Providers are returned, which is information that other rules get to use. These will often contain artifacts. The rule implementation takes in a ctx, which is the rule context. The two most important fields are ctx.attrs, which picks up the attributes declared by the rule, and ctx.actions, which lets you create new actions to actually do something. The output of any actions performed will be materialized in buck-out. However, only the defined outputs of providers are available for dependent rules to consume and only the actions necessary to produce those outputs being consumed will be run. By default, the default_output of the DefaultInfo provider is built and output during a buck build. "},{"title":"Providers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing Rules","url":"/docs/rule_authors/writing_rules/#providers","content":"Providers are the data returned from a rule and are the only way that information from this rule is available to rules that depend on it. Every rule must return at least the DefaultInfo provider, but most will also return either RunInfo (because they are executable) or some custom provider (because they are incorporated into something that is ultimately executable). The DefaultInfo provider has a field default_output, which is the file that will be built when someone executes a buck2 build on this particular target, and the file that will be used when someone runs $(location target) or uses it as a source file (such as srcs = [&quot;:my_target&quot;].) The current rule of thumb is that if you can build the default_output, the rule must 'work', and, if usable, should be 'ready'. For example, for a binary, the executable and runtime libraries it depends on might be returned. For a library, because neither the static or dynamic library is the 'default', you merely have to do enough work to ensure that the static and dynamic library probably work. Similar to how DefaultInfo wraps a list of artifacts and $(location) selects from DefaultInfo, RunInfo wraps a command line and $(exe) selects from RunInfo. For more information about command lines, see Run action, below. For libraries, usually you need to pass some information about the library up to the binary. The only information that dependents on the library get are the providers, so designing the information that flows around the provider is critical to designing good rules. For a hypothetical rule, you may decide you want the name of the library and the artifact that represents the .so file, for which you could define the following provider: PascalLibraryInfo = provider(fields=[ &quot;name&quot;, # The name of the library &quot;object&quot; # An artifact, the .so file that needs linking in ] )  Often, you'll grab your dependencies from all your providers: my_deps = [x[PascalLibraryInfo] for x in ctx.attrs.deps]  In many cases, it becomes apparent you need the transitive closure of all libraries (for example, the libraries and everything they depend upon), in which case, the standard pattern is to move to a provider of a list of record (see the types.md document in GitHub) and the flatten/dedupe functions, defining it as: PascalLibraryInfo = provider(fields=[&quot;links&quot;]) # a list of LinkData LinkData = record(name = str.type, object = &quot;artifact&quot;)  And then consuming it: my_links = dedupe(flatten([x[PascalLibraryInfo].links for x in ctx.attrs.deps])) my_info = PascalLibraryInfo(links = my_links)  However, this flatten/dupe pattern can get expensive, especially when you have a deep dependency graph. To fix that it's recommended to use transitive sets. "},{"title":"Actions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing Rules","url":"/docs/rule_authors/writing_rules/#actions","content":"There are several actions you can use to create symlink trees, and so on. Run action​ Of the various actions, the run action is by far the most important: it's the one that invokes a command line. A command line is both a list of string arguments and a list of artifacts they depend on; with syntactic niceties for adding artifacts to command lines in a way that ensures the dependencies are usually correct. Following are examples of command line manipulations: cmd = cmd_args([&quot;some&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;]) cmd.add(&quot;another-arg&quot;) cmd.add(ctx.attrs.src) # An input artifact out = ctx.actions.declare_output(&quot;an output&quot;) cmd.add(out.as_output()) ctx.actions.run(cmd)  The action declare_output creates a new artifact which is not bound to anything. You can call .as_output() on it when adding it to a command line to say that this command line doesn't take the artifact as an input but produces it as an output. From now on, if out is used as a dependency (either to another command line, or in DefaultInfo) then the action will be run to produce that artifact. Typically, these outputs are declared (declare_output), bound in a ctx.actions.run call with .as_output(), then either used locally as the input to another action or returned in a provider. As another example: cmd = cmd_args([&quot;cp&quot;, input, output.as_output()]) ctx.actions.run(cmd)  A command provides both a string (what to write when used) and a list of artifacts (what must be available when used). Normally, as in the case above, the artifacts that are used correspond to those on the command line. But imagine the rule is changed to write the command to a shell script first: sh = ctx.actions.write(&quot;test.sh&quot;, [&quot;cp&quot;, input, output]) cmd = cmd_args([&quot;sh&quot;,sh]) cmd.hidden([input, output.as_output()]) ctx.actions.run(cmd)  The command has been written to a shell script, which is now run. Beforehand, all the artifacts used by the command appeared on the command line. Now they don't. However, the shell script still accesses input and output. To inform the run command, use the hidden field of the command line to declare the dependency. For more complicated actions, which perform meaningful logic beyond invoking a simple command, the tendency is to write custom Python scripts. Python scripts are used instead of shell scripts as they have better cross-platform compatibility and fewer hidden corners (especially in error paths). As an example of a Python helper, see make_comp_db.py. A further advantage of using Python is that these commands can be tested in isolation, outside of Buck2.

As an example, just below the pascal_binary_impl function, you could write: pascal_binary = rule( impl = pascal_binary_impl, attrs = { &quot;deps&quot;: attrs.list(attrs.dep()), &quot;src&quot;: attrs.source(), } )  "},{"title":"Why Buck2","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/why/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Why does Buck2 exist?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Buck2","url":"/docs/why/#why-does-buck2-exist","content":"Meta employs a very large monorepo, consisting of a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, Haskell, OCaml, and more. Google employs a different but functionally similar monorepo. These large scale and multi-language repositories are generally beyond the capabilities of traditional build systems like make. To optimize the build and performance of these large systems, Facebook and Google developed their own build systems, respectively Buck and Bazel. While the internal version of Bazel was started first (also known as Blaze), Buck was open sourced first (back in March 2013), followed by Bazel a few years later (March 2015). The retroactively named Buck1 was a capable build system and is still in use today at Meta (although many users have migrated). Buck2 is a rewrite that aims to keep the best bits of Buck1 (with a high degree of target compatibility) but also borrows ideas from academic research and build systems, including Bazel, Pants, Shake, Tup, and more. Following are aspects common to Buck1 and Buck2 (and in most cases, Bazel): Targets that can be queried - the build is defined as a series of targets, specified in BUCK files, that depend on other targets. This graph of targets can be queried to understand how they relate to each other and what the potential impact of a change might be.Remote execution - the build can send actions to a set of remote servers to be executed, increasing the parallelism significantly.Multi-language composability - there can be lots of different languages in a single build, and they can be put together. For example, you could have a Python library that depends on a Rust library, which, in turn depends on a C library.File watching - at large enough scale, simply looking for changed files is prohibitively expensive. Buck can integrate with Watchman to discover which files have changed efficiently. However, for simplicity of setup, the open-source version defaults to using inotify or similar functionality.Uses Starlark - Starlark is a deterministic Python-like language used to specify the targets, enabling the definition of targets as literals and more advanced manipulation/sharing. "},{"title":"What's different about Buck2?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Buck2","url":"/docs/why/#whats-different-about-buck2","content":"Buck2 has many minor differences from Buck1, but there are a number that give new efficiency or expressiveness that are of note (most of these are also differences from Bazel). Buck2 is written in Rust - Buck1 was written in Java. One of the advantages of using Rust is the absence of GC pauses, However, Java also has advantages, such as better memory profiling tools.Buck2 is remote execution first - local execution is considered a special case of remote execution, in contrast to Buck1 where it was added after. That means that things such as directory hashes can be pre-computed ready to send to remote execution, giving efficiency benefits.All Buck2 rules are written in Starlark - whereas, in Buck1, they were written in Java as part of the binary, which makes iteration on rules much faster.The Buck2 binary is entirely language agnostic - as a consequence of having all the rules external to the binary, the most important and complex rule (such as in C++), don't have access to magic internal features. As a result, features have been made available to all rules, including: Dep files - the ability to declare that a subset of the files weren't actually used, and thus not be sensitive to changes within them.Incremental actions - the ability to have the action short-circuit some subset of the work if run again. Buck2 uses a dynamic (aka monadic) graph as its underlying computation engine - while most dependencies are specified statically, there are two particular features that expose dynamic power to rule authors: Dynamic dependencies - enable rules to build a file then look at its contents before specifying the dependencies and steps in future actions. Common uses are languages where the dependency structure within a project must follow imports (Haskell, OCaml) and distributed ThinLTO (where the best optimization plan is generated fromAnonymous targets - enable rules to create a graph that has more sharing than the original user graph. As a result, two unrelated binaries can compile shared code only once, despite the shared code not knowing about this commonality. This feature is useful for rules like Swift feature resolution. Transitive-sets - similar in purpose to Bazel's depset. But, instead of being just a memory optimization, are also wired into the dependency graph, providing a reduction in the size of the dependency graph.Buck2 is not phased - there are no target graph/action graph phases, just a series of dependencies in a single graph that result in whatever the user requested. That means that Buck2 can sometimes parallelise different phases and track changes very precisely.Buck2 can integrate with the virtual filesystem Eden - this provides good performance, even when the file system is backed by source control fetches. However, Eden is not required, and a normal file system will also work well.The Buck2 Starlark implementation is available as a standalone library - this provides features such as IDE integration (both LSP and DAP bindings), linters, typecheckers, and more. These features are integrated into Buck2 to give a better developer experience (which is still evolving).Buck2 supports configurations - (such as select) to provide multi-platform/architecture builds, which are heavily inspired by Bazel. Within that space, there is a number of small differences, such as toolchain_deps.Buck2 is fast - in our internal tests, we observed that Buck2 completed builds 2x as fast as Buck1. For a comprehensive list of benefits, see Benefits Compared to Buck1. "},{"title":"Why use Buck2?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Buck2","url":"/docs/why/#why-use-buck2","content":"It would be delightful if you tried out Buck2! But it is early-stage software, so users may run into unexpected issues. If you encounter an issue, please report it via Github issues. Buck2 is being used internally within Meta and is available as open-source from 2023. The are several differences between the internal and open-source versions: Meta uses an internal version of remote execution with builds always hooked up to remote execution. The open-source binding, which uses Buck2 without remote execution, may be less polished.There are some configuration differences between the open source and internal versions. For example, file changes default to inotify in open-source, and to Watchman internally.The prelude (containing all the rules) is the same for open-source as internal, but toolchains are not open-sourced. The required custom toolchains may not work as well. There are also some things that aren't quite yet finished: There are not yet mechanisms to build in release mode (that should be achieved by modifying the toolchain).Windows/Mac builds are still in progress; open-source code is mostly tested on Linux. If none of that puts you off, give Buck2 a go!
